**Practice Exam**
Upcoming
:::

::: exam
Exam 1 will become available Thursday June 29th and due by Sunday July 2nd 11:59pm.

Important:

- Set a timer for 50 minutes (or your ANU time) anything submitted after 50 minutes will receive a 0.
- Strongly suggest making a one page "cheat-sheet". While this exam is open note/open book - if you do not know the material you will NOT finish within the time limit.
- Make sure you SUBMIT every Exercise and Question (not just run code you must click Submit). Unsubmitted exercises = 0
- View your submissions BEFORE locking the exam. Once you lock the exam no changes can be made.
- Strongly suggest taking the practice exam prior.
- I do not check my email on the weekend. If you run into technical difficulties over the weekend, I will respond on Monday. Strongly suggest completing the Exam on Friday if you are ready for it.
- Good luck!
