**Reminders!**

-   Complete Week 4 first!
-   Make sure you review the [Activity Solutions](/course-solutions.html)
-   I suggest spacing out the lessons so you are working on 1 a day.
- Chapters 9 - 12 are hard! Make sure you attend office hours if you are struggling. Do NOT procrastinate! If you wait until the last day to start these you probably will not finish.
