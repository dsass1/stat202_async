Take [Practice Exam 3](https://amkuyper.shinyapps.io/sample_exam3_v2/)

-   The actual exam will be self-timed (set a timer!) anything submitted after 60 minutes will not be graded.

::: exam
Exam 3 is due by Friday July 28th 11:59pm CT.

Important:

-   Set a timer for 60 minutes (or your ANU time).
-   Don't spend too long on one question! Pace yourself. Students take these exams during the school year in 50 minutes - I am giving you 10 extra minutes.
-   Strongly suggest making a one page "cheat-sheet". While this exam is open note/open book - **if you do not understand the material you will NOT finish within the time limit - study**!.
-   Make sure you SUBMIT every Exercise and Question (not just run code you must click Submit). Unsubmitted exercises = 0
-   Check your submissions BEFORE locking the exam. Once you lock the exam no changes can be made.
-   Strongly suggest taking the practice exam prior.
-   I do not check my email on the weekend. If you run into technical difficulties over the weekend, I will respond on Monday.
-   Good luck!
