I would love to know and understand how is working with R from the beginning. How can R be applied/implemented in my Research or future job experience? Perhaps it can be a topic for some OH :)

The materials are awesome and RC really help. The book is a wonderful resource and the practice exercises are great. I just think it could provide us the answer, or just for odd exercises. ",0.0,5,6,1.0

So far I really like this class and I've learned a lot more than Stats 210, which is like the other ""intro to stats"" course. The reason why I selected to take this class even though I already had a stats credit was because I felt like Stats 210 was more about pure memorization and didn't really go over how to interpret answers, so I didn't really learn anything other than a few formulas.

The lecture slides, reading checks, and activities during class allow me to really absorb the information we learn and apply it to the test. Although the textbook is sometimes really difficult to understand, I think the constant application of the material breaks down tough topics and commits a lot of information to memory. Even though I made a cheat sheet for the test, I barely even needed to use it. Right now, I find the information fun and interesting to learn, especially data wrangling. However, I hope the material gets even more engaging throughout the quarter.",0.0,4,7,1.0

I love the organization and the course website, I transferred into the class a week late and was able to understand everything thanks to the class slides and lecture recordings. Now, I love the structure of classes with lectures first and then practice beginning in class so I can collaborate with peers and ask any questions before finishing the assignment later on my own. The activities and reading checks are the perfect amounts of practice, while there is work outside the class it is not overwhelming and the repetition helps with learning. ",0.0,5,6,1.0
