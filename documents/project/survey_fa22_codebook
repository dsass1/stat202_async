Data collected from survey given to Norwestern STAT 202 students during the Fall 2021, Winter 2022, Spring 2022, Summer 2022, and Fall 2022 quarters. Some students chose not to answer all questions, meaning some questions/variables will have missing responses (missing data).

Removed students that identified gender as other to protect against the possibility of having their responses identified by other students. The number of those identifying as other is small enough that someone might be able to figure out their responses. 

New variables introduced in Spring 2022: fav_drink, num_party, personality, fav_sport, hrs_sleep, procrastinator, 
birth_order, birth_month, netflix, hulu, amazon_prime, hbo_max, disney_plus, fav_season, campus_housing,
