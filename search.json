Pace yourself. Students take these exams during the school year in 50 minutes - I am giving you 10 extra minutes.\nStrongly suggest making a one page “cheat-sheet”. While this exam is open note/open book - if you do not understand the material you will NOT finish within the time limit - study!.\nMake sure you SUBMIT every Exercise and Question (not just run code you must click Submit)\nCheck your submissions BEFORE locking the exam. Once you lock the exam no changes can be made.\nStrongly suggest taking the practice exam prior.\nI do not check my email on the weekend. If you run into technical difficulties over the weekend, I will respond on Monday.\nGood luck!\n\n\nExam directions - same as Exam 1 but might be a good refresher.\n\nTake Exam 2\nSubmit Exam 2"

But it could give you a starting place and then you will want to increase the number of bins until you can properly see the shape."

Why? I have a grading deadline and being able to grade some projects early is a huge help. Do NOT rush to turn in a project early simply for the bonus point. The bonus will not make up for a poor quality project; only turn your project in early if you can submit a quality report by then.\nThe final project is to be completed alone or in groups of 2-4.\nGroups are expected to submit their project electronically to Canvas, similar to how you submit your work for daily activities. You will type your project directly into a qmd file and knit an html document. You should submit both your .qmd and .html file (and dataset if you chose one other than the one I provided). Only ONE person from the group needs to submit the project. Make sure everyone’s name is on the project. Failure to submit both the .qmd and .html will result in a deduction.\nThis should read as a report! The project should be in paragraphs and complete sentences within the context of your dataset when appropriate. Do not bold or italicize your entire paper. Do not begin a section with code, you should introduce context before showing graphics/code. Students are expected to also show their work (i.e., include your R code). Your target audience is the grader and myself, we want to see your code and the output of your code."

This dataset will be pre-loaded and located in the Posit Cloud Project.\n\nClass Survey Data: You cannot use any analysis that is an existing question on your exam. You may think of a similar question but it should not be identical. You must use the full dataset, the midterm and final remove certain columns and observations to reduce time computations. See the codebook in the Posit Cloud Project for an explanation of the variables.\n\nOption 2:\nAs a group you can pick a dataset of interest to explore! This can be any dataset of your choice that meets the following criteria:\n\nAt least 100 observations\nAt least 10 variables\nThe variables should be a mix of both categorical and numeric\nAt least one variable that can be used as a reasonable response variable for regression\nYou may not use data that has previously been used in any Activity\nYou may not use any data that is a part of the ISDSdatasets, ggplot2, or palmerpenguins packages.\n\nIf you choose your own dataset, you will need to upload your data to the RStudio Cloud Project. Under the Files Pane, click on the “data” folder, then click the “upload” icon.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhere to find data?\n\nKaggle: Kaggle offers aggregated datasets, but it’s a community hub rather than a search engine. Kaggle launched in 2010 with a number of machine learning competitions, which subsequently solved problems for the likes of NASA and Ford. It has since evolved into a renowned open data platform, offering cloud-based collaboration for data scientists, as well as educational tools for teaching artificial intelligence and data analysis techniques… plus, of course, tons of great datasets covering almost any topic you can imagine.\nGoogle Dataset Search: Launched in 2018, Google Dataset Search is like Google’s standard search engine, but strictly for data. While it’s not the best tool if you prefer to browse, if you have a particular topic or keyword in mind, it won’t disappoint. Google Dataset Search aggregates data from external sources, providing a clear summary of what’s available, a description of the data, who it’s provided by, and when it was last updated. It’s an excellent place to start.\nU.S. Census Bureau: the U.S. Census Bureau publishes reams of demographic data at the state, city, and even zip code level. It is a fantastic data set for students interested in creating geographic data visualizations and can be accessed on the Census Bureau website. Alternatively, the data can be accessed via an API.\nData.gov: In 2015, the US Government made all its data publicly available. With over 200,000 datasets covering everything from climate change to crime, you can lose yourself in the database for hours. For a government website, it has some surprisingly user-friendly search functions, including the ability to drill down by geographical area, organization type, and file format. Search results are also clearly labeled at federal, state, county, and city levels. \nFiveThirtyEight: If you’re interested in data at all, you’ve almost certainly heard of FiveThirtyEight; it’s one of the best-established data journalism outlets in the world. They write interesting data-driven articles, like “Don’t blame a skills gap for lack of hiring in manufacturing” and “2016 NFL Predictions”. What you may not know is that FiveThirtyEight also makes the data sets used in its articles available online on Github and on its own data portal.\nFBI Crime Data Explorer: If you’re fascinated by crime, the FBI Crime Data Explorer is the one for you. It provides a broad collection of crime statistics from a variety of state organizations (universities and local law enforcement) and government (on a local, regional, and state-level). Pull data on hate crimes, officer assaults, homicides, and more. It also includes some helpful user guides to support data navigation.\nAwesome Public Datasets: This github hosts a library of awesome, public datasets! They are all sorted by category and link you straight to the hosting website.\nSports Reference: “Our Primary Aim is to answer our users’ questions with the easiest-to-use, fastest, and most complete sports statistics anywhere. If we have some fun in the process, that’s good too.”\nAnywhere you want to search!"

This is a report, meaning anytime you have code you should be explaining what you are doing before the code and any conclusions/findings that result after the code. In other words, there should not be random plots/code without any explanation.\n\nIntroduction: Should introduce your dataset, where the data came from, why it is of interest, and any other general introductory statements. Is your dataset generalizable, and if so what is the population of interest? Cite your data link if necessary.\nData Overview: Here you should describe your data. How many variables are in your dataset? How many observations? Are there any missingness issues and why might that be the case? Are there any potential data issues such as impossible/weird values?\nEDA: You will need to create a minimum of 2 graphics to explore your data. You cannot use the two same graphs (ie: cannot do 2 scatterplots). These graphics must be made using ggplot, however you are welcome to explore other geom layers that we have not focused on in this class beyond the 5NG. Each graph must have wrangling code that provides appropriate calculations to support the graph. This is a report, meaning there should be a proper description and explanation of the graph.\nRegression: Choose 1 numeric and 1 categorical variable to predict a numeric variable. You choose if this is a parallel slopes or interaction model. Write out the equation to your model. Interpret each coefficient in the context of the problem. Provide a graph of the fitted lines.^1\nConfidence interval: Develop a confidence interval related research question. Construct you confidence interval, state your confidence level and appropriately interpret in the context of the problem.\nHypothesis test: Develop a hypothesis test related research question. State your null and alternative hypothesis, specify your alpha, perform the hypothesis test, and appropriately interpret in the context of the problem.^2\nConclusion: State any concluding remarks.\n\n1: Advanced tip for regression: If you want to visualize your prediction you can plot the observed response on the x axis and the fitted values on the y axis.\n2: The confidence interval and hypothesis test must be answering different research questions. The confidence interval/hypothesis test cannot be of the same type (options: mean, proportion, difference in mean, difference in proportion, slope)"

Ex: Simple exploration: histogram of a single variable using your entire dataset and calculating the mean and standard deviation. Complex exploration: faceting a histogram by a categorical variable and calculating summary statistics by category to explain how different categories vary.\n**Be a problem solver.

Each reading check will be scaled to be worth 10 points.\nThe lowest two grades will be dropped at the end of the quarter.\n\n\nActivities and small assignments\nDaily activities will be worth 10 points and primarily graded for completion. Breakdown of points: 10 points fully complete; 5 points partially complete; 0 not complete. Since the exercises are not graded for accuracy you need to make sure that you check your answers against the solutions. Small assignments are generally surveys.\nThe lowest two activity grades will be dropped at the end of the quarter.\n\n\nExams\nThere will be 3 open-note exams; they will be structured very similarly to your reading checks. Half of it will focus on conceptual knowledge and half will focus on practical applications. The exams are timed 50 minutes and are not cumulative.\n\n\nProject\nThe final project can be completed individually or in groups of up to 4 people. More information will be provided later in the quarter.\n\n\nMissed Exam Policy\nThere are no make-up exams. The exam must be completed and submitted during the exam window."
