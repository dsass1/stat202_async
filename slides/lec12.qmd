## Key Definitions

::: incremental
-   **Observational study**: can show the correlation between two variables but difficult to show causation. This is because there could be a confounding variable causing both to happen (e.g. voluntary assignment).

-   **Randomized experiment** (Gold Standard): avoids the issues with confounding variables by comparing two groups (treatment and control) that look on **average** the same.

-   **Confounders**: alternative explanations for differences between the experimental groups. Confounding variables correlate with both the experimental groups and the outcome variable.

## Example

Does eating ice cream cause drowning?

Experiment:

-   Control group: do not eat ice cream

-   Treatment group: eat ice cream

::: panel-tabset
## Scenario 1

We randomly divide a population into the treatment and control groups and compare the number of drownings between groups.

::: incremental
-   Type of experiment: randomized experiment
-   Types of conclusions can we make: causal conclusions
:::

## Scenario 2

We have survey data of the number of monthly ice cream sales and number of monthly drownings and calculate a correlation of 0.85.

::: incremental
-   Type of experiment: observational study
-   Types of conclusions can we make: correlation only conclusions (possible confounding variables)

## Key Ideas

Â 

-   Randomized assignment helps **separate causation from correlation**.

-   Additionally, randomized assignment helps **rule out confounding variables**.

## Using randomization in R

Bernoulli trial = randomized experiment with exactly two outcomes.

-   In R: `rbernoulli(n = ____, p = ____)`

. . .

It can be framed as a "yes or no" (success or failure) question.

. . .

**Examples**:

-   Whether or not flipping a coin results in heads

. . .

-   Whether or not you roll a 1 when rolling a die
