## Overview

**Definitions**

::: incremental
-   Population: collection of individuals (units) in which we are interested
-   Sample: collection of individuals (units) from the population
:::

. . .

**Goal**

Use trends in a sample to make inference about a population.

## Notation

<br>

|            | Size | Proportion         | Mean      | Standard Deviation |
|------------|------|--------------------|-----------|--------------------|
| Population | N    | $\pi$              | $\mu$     | $\sigma$           |
| Sample     | n    | $p$ or $\hat{\pi}$ | $\bar{x}$ | $s$                |

## Example 1 {.smaller}

In a survey of 1,500 parents in the United States, 73% said they wanted to resume in person school for their children for 2021.

::: incremental
What is the population?

-   parents in the US

What is the sample?

-   1,500 parents surveyed

What "notation" is used to represent 73%

-   $p$ because 73% is a sample statistic and proportion

## Random Sampling and Assignment

**Random Sampling**: how you draw the observations from the population

. . .

-   allows for generalizable claims

. . .

**Random Assignment**: how you assign the sample into treatment/control groups

. . .

-   allows for causal claims.

## Example 2 {.smaller}

:::

You want to evaluate the effectiveness of the Pfizer vaccine on COVID. You ask for 1,000 volunteers and randomly give half of the volunteers the vaccine and the other half a placebo dose. These people get tested for COVID every week for a year and we record who tests positive for COVID during this time and their symptoms.

<br>

. . .

**What type of conclusions can we draw?**

a)  causal conclusions generalized to the whole population
b)  causal conclusions only applicable to the sample
c)  no causal conclusions (correlation only) generalized to the whole population
d)  no causal conclusions (correlation only) only applicable to the sample

## Types of random sampling {.smaller}

::: incremental
-   **Simple Random**: observations are selected randomly from the population, each having an equal chance of being selected.
-   **Cluster Sampling**: first the population is divided into sub-groups, and then x sub-groups out of all groups are randomly selected.
-   **Stratified Sampling**: first the population is divided into sub-groups, and then within each sub-group x observations are randomly selected.
-   **Systematic Sampling**: select some starting point, then every $k^{th}$ observation of the population is selected.

Northwestern University is deciding which undergraduate students to test for COVID this week and due to limited resources they cannot test the entire undergraduate student body at once.

-   **Population of interest**: undergraduate students at NU

::: panel-tabset
## Scenario 1

The university divides the population into 4 groups {1st year, sophomore, junior, seniors} and randomly selects 200 students from each group to test.

What type of sampling is this?

a)  simple random
b)  cluster sampling
c)  stratified sampling
d)  systematic sampling
e)  none of the above

## Scenario 2

The university alphabetizes the population by last name and selects every $25^{th}$ student to get tested.

What type of sampling is this?

a)  simple random
b)  cluster sampling
c)  stratified sampling
d)  systematic sampling
e)  none of the above

## Scenario 3

The university alphabetizes the population by last name and selects the first 200 students to get tested.

What type of sampling is this?

a)  simple random
b)  cluster sampling
c)  stratified sampling
d)  systematic sampling
e)  none of the above
