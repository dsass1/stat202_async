## The Standard Normal Distribution

::: columns
::: {.column width="50%"}
<br>

<img src="images_lecture/standard_normal.png" style="float: center;"/>
:::

::: {.column width="50%"}
**Properties**

::: incremental
-   The area under the curve is 1 (or 100%)
-   The mean of the distribution is 0
-   The standard deviation of the distribution is 1
:::

Can use the normal distribution in R or at https://homepage.divms.uiowa.edu/\~mbognar/applets/normal.html

:::

::: {.column width="52%"}
::: incremental
-   Around **68%** of values are within **one** standard deviation from the mean.
-   Around **95%** of values are within **two** standard deviations from the mean.
-   Around **99.7%** of values are within **three** standard deviations from the mean.

. . .

**Why is this useful?** If we know the mean and standard deviation of a variable that follows the normal distribution, we can calculate the probability of an event occurring.

. . .

**How is this applicable?** We can transform any normally distributed variable into a standard normal distribution with **standardization**.

. . .

$$\hbox{STAT} = \frac{X - mean(X)}{sd(X)}$$

## The Normal Distribution

::: incremental
-   Changing $\mu$ (mu, the mean), changes where the center (peak) of the distribution is located.
-   Changing $\sigma$ (sigma, the standard deviation), changes the spread of the distribution.
-   The shape of the distribution never changes. It is always unimodal and symmetric (no skew).

## The T-Distribution {.smaller}

The t-distribution is similar in shape to a normal distribution.

<br>

::: columns
::: {.column width="48%"}
<center>![](images_lecture/t-dist.png)</center>
:::

::: {.column width="52%"}
::: incremental
-   Completely characterized by it's degrees of freedom (df). A parameter defined based on the sample size $n$.
-   As we make the degrees of freedom ($df$) larger the t-distribution is getting closer to the standard normal distribution.
-   The normal distribution assumes that you know the population standard deviation, $\sigma$. The t-distribution is used if you only know the sample standard deviation, $s$ (ie: $\sigma$ unknown).

## Normal Distribution in R

`pnorm()` calculates the probability to the left of a quantile

```{r norm-dist}
#| echo: true
#| eval: false
# Calculate the probability of being to the left of quantile -1
pnorm(q = -1, mean = 0, sd = 1)
```

. . .

`qnorm()` calculates the quantile with p% of data to the left

```{r}
#| echo: true
#| eval: false
# Calculate the quantile, with 20% of data to the left
# default is mean = 0 and sd = 1
qnorm(p = .2)
```

. . .

Setting `lower.tail = FALSE` calculates/uses area to the **right**

```{r}
#| echo: true
#| eval: false
# lower.tail = FALSE changes it to data/area to the right
# specify mean and sd if you are not using a standard normal distribution
qnorm(p = .025, mean = 10, sd = 2, lower.tail = FALSE)
```

## Example 1

For a standard normal distribution, what is the probability of being less than one standard deviation below the mean?

::: columns
::: {.column width="40%"}
<img src="images_lecture/standard_normal.png" style="float: center;"/>
:::

::: {.column width="60%"}
<br>

::: fragment
```{r}
pnorm(q = -1)
```
:::
:::
:::

## Example 2

For a standard normal distribution, find the STAT (CV) for being in the highest 30%.

::: columns
::: {.column width="40%"}
<img src="images_lecture/standard_normal.png" style="float: center;"/>
:::

::: {.column width="60%"}
<br>

::: fragment
```{r}
qnorm(p = 0.3, lower.tail = FALSE)

# OR

qnorm(p = 0.7)
```
:::

## Example 3 {.smaller}

::: {.absolute top="0%" left="90%" width="100"}
![](images_lecture/participate_icon.png)
:::

The amount of money spent buying weekly groceries follows a normal distribution. We are lucky enough to know the population mean is \$150 and the population standard deviation is \$20. Find the probability an individual spent less than \$120.

## Using data

::: columns
::: {.column width="40%"}
<img src="images_lecture/normal_dist.png" style="float: center;"/>
:::

::: {.column width="60%"}
::: fragment
```{r}
# Standardize
pnorm(q = 120, mean = 150, sd = 20)
```
:::
:::
:::

## Standardize

::: columns
::: {.column width="40%"}
<img src="images_lecture/standard_normal.png" style="float: center;"/>
:::

::: {.column width="60%"}
::: fragment
```{r}
# Standardize
pnorm(q = -1.5)
```

<br> You can transform any normally distributed variable onto a standardized scale.

## T-distribution in R

VERY similar to normal distribution but...

`pt()` calculates the probability to the left of a quantile for a t-distribution

`qt()` calculates the quantile with p% of data to the left for a t-distribution

```{r t-dist}
#| echo: true
#| eval: false
# no mean and sd! Now we use df
# these examples are using 9 degrees or freedom
pt(q = -1, df = 9)
qt(p = .025, df = 9)
qt(p = .025, df = 9, lower.tail = FALSE)
```
