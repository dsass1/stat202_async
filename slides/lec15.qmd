## Overview{.smaller}

The theory of **repeated samples** makes it possible for statisticians to take a random sample from a population and use it to make inference about that population's parameters.

. . .

<br>

**Definitions:**

:::{.incremental}
-   **Repeated Sampling**: repeating the exact same random sampling procedure many times.
-   **Sampling variability**: some sample estimates are bigger and some smaller than the true population statistic
-   **Standard error**: the standard deviation of a sampling distribution
-   **Sampling Distribution**: a probability distribution of a statistic (mean, proportion, or variation) obtained from repeated sampling. This distribution is visualized with a histogram.

## Simulations in R{.smaller}

The theory of repeated samples is quite straight forward:

:::{.incremental}
1.  Imagine repeating the exact same *random sampling* procedure where you sampled 50 people from the population, say 10,000 times.\
2.  For each of the 10,000 samples, each with 50 people in them, calculate a sample statistic, say the sample mean. That is, you now have 10,000 sample means.
3.  Now examine the distribution of the 10,000 sample means. This distribution of sample means is know as a sampling distribution. A distribution that is the result of repeated sampling.

. . .

**Code in R**:

```{r rep-sample}
#| echo: true
#| eval: false
sim_data <- data %>% 
  rep_sample_n(size = 50, reps = 10000)
```

## Simple example {.smaller}

Let's say we want to estimate the average height of a college student. You take a random sample of size 2. And repeat this procedure 4 times.
