## Why do we need CIs? {.smaller}

Reporting a range of values via a confidence interval takes into account the uncertainty (sampling variation) associated with the fact that we are observing a single random sample.

::: incremental
-   We know a sampling distribution (thousands of replicate samples) center around the population parameter.
-   We don't know the true value of the population parameter.
-   We know a sampling distribution is normally distributed (CLT)
-   We have no idea where our single sample falls in the sampling distribution (close to the population parameter or far away).

## Check your understanding

::: {.absolute top="0%" left="90%" width="100"}
![](images_lecture/participate_icon.png)
:::

When we use a $95\%$ critical value, approximately $95\%$ of the confidence intervals contain the true population parameter (e.g. $\mu$, $\mu_1 - \mu_2$, $\pi$, etc).

<br>

Say we generate 20,000 sample means and construct a 95% CI for each sample. How many of the constructed confidence intervals do you expect to contain the true population mean?

. . .

-   We EXPECT 20000\*.95 = 19,000 of the constructed confidence intervals to contain the true population mean.

## Width of an Interval (Margin of Error) {.smaller}

$$\mathbf{\hbox{Margin of Error}} = \hbox{Critical  Value} * SE(\hbox{Estimator})$$

. . .

There is a trade-off between the width of an interval and the level of confidence (critical value).

::: incremental
-   Using a lower CI (ex: 90% vs 95%) **decreases** the margin of error (narrower interval), but a narrower CI increase the chance that your interval will not capture the true mean.
-   A 99% CI has a higher chance of capturing the true mean than a 95% CI, but it might be too wide of an interval to be practically useful.
-   You can also **decrease** the margin of error by **increasing** sample size.

## Example {.smaller}

Let's consider our example from last lecture. You are interested in the average weight of penguins in Antarctica. Let's say we are able to obtain a random sample of penguins in Antarctica (for example purposes this **random sample** will be the `penguins` dataset from the `palmerpenguins` package.)

::: panel-tabset
## Baseline

Construct a 95% confidence interval for the population mean.


```{r}
t.test(penguins$body_mass_g, conf.level = 0.95)
```


## Lower CI

Construct a 90% confidence interval instead.

```{r}
t.test(penguins$body_mass_g, conf.level = 0.90)
```

## Smaller n

What if we only had a sample size of 50? Construct a 95% confidence interval.

```{r}
penguins_sample <- penguins %>% 
  sample_n(size = 50)

t.test(penguins_sample$body_mass_g, conf.level = 0.95)
```

## Extra practice {.smaller}

We are interested in making inferences about penguins that live near Palmer Station, Antarctica. We will use the `penguins` data from the `palmerpenguins` package as our "random" sample. 

1. Construct a 90% CI for the difference in average flipper length between the Adelie penguins and the Gentoo.

2. Construct a 97% CI for the proportion of penguins that are of the Gentoo species.

3. Construct a 99% CI for the difference in the proportion of female penguins of the Adelie or Chinstrap species that weight over 4000 g and the proportion of male penguins of the Adelie or Chinstrap that weigh over 4000 g

4. Run a simple linear regression to predict `body_mass_g` based on `flipper_length_mm`. What is the 97% confidence interval for the slope?

## Solutions {.smaller}

::: panel-tabset
## 1

Construct a 90% CI for the difference in average flipper length between the Adelie penguins and the Gentoo penguins.

```{r}
penguins_adelie <- penguins %>% 
  filter(species == "Adelie")

penguins_gentoo <- penguins %>% 
  filter(species == "Gentoo")

t.test(x = penguins_adelie$flipper_length_mm, 
       y = penguins_gentoo$flipper_length_mm,
       conf.level = 0.9)
```
We are 90% confident that the difference in average flipper length of the Adelie species and Gentoo species of penguins in Palmer Station, Antarctica is between -28.54 and -25.93 mm.

(This means we are 90% confident the Adelie species flippers are between 25.93 and 28.54 mm shorter than the Gentoo species for penguins in Palmer Station, Antarctica.)
