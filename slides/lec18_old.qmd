## Why do we need CIs? {.smaller}

Reporting a range of values via a confidence interval takes into account the uncertainty (sampling variation) associated with the fact that we are observing a single random sample.

::: incremental
-   We know a sampling distribution (thousands of replicate samples) center around the population parameter.
-   We don't know the true value of the population parameter.
-   We know a sampling distribution is normally distributed (CLT)
-   We have no idea where our single sample falls in the sampling distribution (close to the population parameter or far away).

## Check your understanding

:::

When we use a $95\%$ critical value, approximately $95\%$ of the confidence intervals contain the true population parameter (e.g. $\mu$, $\mu_1 - \mu_2$, $\pi$, etc).

<br>

Say we generate 20,000 sample means and construct a 95% CI for each sample. How many of the constructed confidence intervals do you expect to contain the true population mean?

. . .

-   We EXPECT 20000\*.95 = 19,000 of the constructed confidence intervals to contain the true population mean.

## Width of an Interval (Margin of Error) {.smaller}

$$\mathbf{\hbox{Margin of Error}} = \hbox{Critical  Value} * SE(\hbox{Estimator})$$

. . .

There is a trade-off between the width of an interval and the level of confidence (critical value).

::: incremental
-   Using a lower CI (ex: 90% vs 95%) **decreases** the margin of error (narrower interval), but a narrower CI increase the chance that your interval will not capture the true mean.
-   A 99% CI has a higher chance of capturing the true mean than a 95% CI, but it might be too wide of an interval to be practically useful.
-   You can also **decrease** the margin of error by **increasing** sample size.

## Example {.smaller}

::: panel-tabset
## Baseline

You sample 80 newborn babies and calculate a mean weight of 7.5 pounds and standard deviation of 0.7 pounds.

We want to construct a 95% confidence interval for the population mean.

::: incremental
-   **Given values**: $\bar{x} = 7.5$, $s = 0.7$

-   **Calculate SE**: $SE = \frac{0.7}{\sqrt{80}} = 0.078$

-   **Calculate Critical Value**: `qt(p=0.025, df=79)` $= -1.99$

-   **Resulting CI**: $7.5 \pm 1.99*0.078 = [7.34, 7.66]$
:::

## Lower CI

Construct a 90% confidence interval instead. The sample mean weight is still 7.5 pounds and sample standard deviation is 0.7 pounds and n = 80.

::: incremental
-   **Given values**: $\bar{x} = 7.5$, $s = 0.7$

-   **Calculate SE**: $SE = \frac{0.7}{\sqrt{80}} = 0.078$

-   **Calculate Critical Value**: `qt(p=0.05, df=79)` $= -1.66$

-   **Resulting CI**: $7.5 \pm 1.66*0.078 = [7.37, 7.62]$
:::

## Larger n

Increase the sample size to 200 newborn babies. The sample mean weight is still 7.5 pounds and sample standard deviation is 0.7 pounds.

Construct a 95% confidence interval for the population mean.

::: incremental
-   **Given values**: $\bar{x} = 7.5$, $s = 0.7$

-   **Calculate SE**: $SE = \frac{0.7}{\sqrt{200}} = 0.0495$

-   **Calculate Critical Value**: `qt(p=0.025,df=199)` $= -1.97$

-   **Resulting CI**: $7.5 \pm 1.97*0.0495 = [7.40, 7.60]$
