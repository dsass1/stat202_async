## Overview

<br>

::: incremental
-   We have a claim about a population parameter and form competing hypothesis to test the claim.

-   We then determine which hypothesis is better supported by our sample data.

-   We are always forming the hypothesis about a population parameter.
:::

## Hypothesis test

<br>

$H_0$ (Null Hypothesis): The population parameter is a particular value and any observed sample differences is due to chance variation. This is what we expect.

<br>

$H_A$ (Alternative Hypothesis): There is a reason besides chance that explains the sample data.

## Writing hypotheses examples

::: columns
::: {.column width="40%"}
$H_0$: $\mu=5$

$H_A$: $\mu\ne5$
:::

::: {.column width="40%"}
$H_0$: $\pi=0.5$

$H_A$: $\pi\ne0.5$
:::
:::

<br>

::: columns
::: {.column width="40%"}
$H_0$: $\mu_1-\mu_2=0$

$H_A$: $\mu_1-\mu_2\ne0$
:::

::: {.column width="40%"}
$H_0$: $\beta_1=0$

$H_A$: $\beta_1\ne0$
:::
:::

. . .

<br>

These are called two-sided tests. There also exists one-sided tests ex: $H_0: \pi \geq 0.5$ vs $H_A: \pi < 0.5$ but they are NOT necessary. We can (and should) **ALWAYS** use a two-sided test.

## P-values

::: incremental
-   In order to determine if the null hypothesis is likely to be true we calculate a p-value.

-   **p-value**: probability of observing an estimate as extreme as the one you observed from the data if the null was true.

-   A small p-value means the observed sample data is unlikely to occur under the null hypothesis. ie: proof by contradiction. Reject the null hypothesis because it is probably not true.

## Two-sample (two-sided) tests

For two-sample tests there are 2 ways to calculate the SE

-   Assume the two samples have the same variance and use a pooled (equal variance) formula
-   Assume the two samples have unequal variances and use an unpooled (unequal variance) formula

## Example 1 {.smaller}

You heard a zoologist claim the average weight of penguins is 4250 g.

You want to test this claim so you collect a random sample of penguins and measure their weight, stored in the `penguins` dataset from the `palmerpenguins` package.

$H_A:$

```{r}
t.test(x = penguins$body_mass_g, mu = 4250)
```

## Example 2 {.smaller}

You think that 33% of penguins belong to the Adelie species.

You want to test this claim so you collect a random sample of penguins and count how many are of the Adelie species, stored in the `penguins` dataset from the `palmerpenguins` package.

```{r}
penguins %>% 
  count(species)
