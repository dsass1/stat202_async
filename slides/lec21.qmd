## Steps for conducting a Hypothesis test

1.  Formulate a hypothesis. Define $H_0$ and $H_A$.
2.  Determine a significance level ($\alpha$), Type I error rate.
3.  Determine your distribution under $H_0$ (t-dist or normal).
4.  Collect your sample data and compute the test statistic.
5.  Determine the p-value based on the test statistic.
6.  Draw conclusions in the context of the problem.

## Decision Making

You must select a significance level, $\alpha$ **before** collecting the data

. . .

-   When p-value $< \alpha$ we reject the null hypothesis.
-   When p-value $\geq \alpha$ we fail to reject the null hypothesis.

## Sample Interpretation

<br>

Assuming **NULL HYPOTHESIS IS TRUE IN CONTEXT OF PROBLEM**, there is about a **PVALUE**% chance of see data as extreme as mine. Since the p-value is less than (or greater than) our threshold **ALPHA**%, we reject (or fail to reject) the null hypothesis. This means **CONCLUSION IN CONTEXT OF PROBLEM**.

## Two-tail vs one-tail tests {.smaller}

::: incremental
-   One-tailed tests provides more power to detect an effect. You may be tempted to use a one-tailed test whenever you have a hypothesis about the direction of an effect.
-   Before doing so, consider the **consequences of missing an effect in the other direction** and consider the **consequences of increasing your type 1 error rate**
-   You can and almost always should use a two-tailed test NO MATTER how the problem is worded.
-   We focus on **two-tailed** tests in this class because it is the safe option and we do NOT want to miss an effect in the opposite direction.

## Example

Imagine you have developed a new drug that you believe is an improvement over an existing drug. You wish to maximize your ability to detect the improvement, so you opt for a one-tailed test.

. . .

-   In doing so, you fail to test for the possibility that the new drug is less effective than the existing drug.

. . .

-   The consequences in this example are extreme, but they illustrate a danger of inappropriate use of a one-tailed test.

**Which type of error is usually more of a priority?**

<!-- ::: incremental -->
<!-- -   Depends on the situation -->

**Which type of error is usually easier to control? Why?**

<!-- ::: incremental -->
<!-- -   Type I error because we choose the alpha level -->

## Deeper Understanding (continued)

![](images_lecture/participate_icon.png)
:::

**Can we lower both errors at the same time?**

<!-- ::: incremental -->
<!-- -   NO! -->
<!-- -   There is a tradeoff between the two errors -->
<!-- -   It is not a 1-to-1 tradeoff -->

**Can we know if we made a correct decision?**

<!-- ::: incremental -->
<!-- -   NO -->
<!-- -   We do not know the truth, that is why we are conducting a hypothesis test -->
<!-- ::: -->

## Deeper Understanding (continued) {.smaller}

**How does sample size impact decision making?**

::: incremental
-   Increasing the sample size decreases the p-value and the standard error while making the STAT more extreme
-   As a result, it is harder to detect statistical significance and reject the null with a smaller sample size
